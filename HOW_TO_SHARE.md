# 🔗 SHARING YOUR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT

## How to Get and Share Your Vercel Links

---

## 📍 FINDING YOUR VERCEL URLS

### After Deployment, You'll Get 3 Types of URLs:

#### 1. **Production URL** (Main Link to Share)
```
Format: https://your-project-name.vercel.app
Example: https://operation-finance.vercel.app
```
**This is your main, permanent URL** - Share this one!

#### 2. **Preview URLs** (For Testing)
```
Format: https://your-project-name-git-branchname-username.vercel.app
Example: https://operation-finance-git-main-sakshammishra.vercel.app
```
These are generated for each branch/PR - Good for testing before production

#### 3. **Deployment-Specific URLs**
```
Format: https://operation-finance-abc123xyz.vercel.app
```
Each deployment gets a unique URL - Useful for tracking specific versions
