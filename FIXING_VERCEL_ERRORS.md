# 🔧 FIXING VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ERRORS

## Current Issue: All Deployments Failing

Based on your screenshot, all deployments show **Error** status after ~1m 30s.

---

## 🔍 DIAGNOSIS STEPS

### Step 1: Check Build Logs

1. **Click on any failed deployment** (e.g., the latest one: 5nKGEv8eU)
2. **Look at the "Building" tab** - This shows the exact error
3. Common errors to look for:
   - Root directory not found
   - Build command failed
   - Module not found
   - Out of memory

### Step 2: Common Issues & Fixes

---

## ⚠️ MOST LIKELY ISSUE: Root Directory

Your Next.js app is in a **subdirectory**, not the root. Vercel might be looking in the wrong place.

### **FIX: Set Root Directory**

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll to **"Root Directory"**
4. Click **"Edit"**
5. Enter: `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`
6. Click **"Save"**
7. Go to **Deployments** tab
8. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment

---

## 🛠️ OTHER COMMON FIXES

### Issue 1: Build Command Problems

**Symptoms:** "Command failed" or "npm install failed"

**Fix in Vercel Settings:**
```
Build Command: cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm run build
Install Command: cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm install
Output Directory: Frontend/material-kit-react-main/.next
```

### Issue 2: Node Version

**Symptoms:** "Unsupported Node version"

**Fix:** Add to `Frontend/material-kit-react-main/package.json`:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0",
  "npm": ">=9.0.0"
}
```

### Issue 3: Missing Dependencies

**Symptoms:** "Cannot find module '@vercel/speed-insights'"

**Fix:** Run locally first:
```bash
cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main
npm install
npm run build
```

If successful locally, push to trigger new deployment.

### Issue 4: Environment Variables

**Symptoms:** Build succeeds but app doesn't work

**Fix:** In Vercel Settings → Environment Variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
(Update later when backend is deployed)

---

## 🚀 QUICK FIX PROCEDURE

### Option A: Fix via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

```
1. Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings
2. Find: "Root Directory" section
3. Click: "Edit"
4. Enter: Frontend/material-kit-react-main
5. Click: "Save"
6. Go to: Deployments tab
7. Click: "..." menu on latest deployment
8. Select: "Redeploy"
```

### Option B: Fix via vercel.json

Update the `vercel.json` file at the **root** of your repository:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": "Frontend/material-kit-react-main/.next"
}
```

Then commit and push:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: Update vercel.json with correct paths"
git push origin main
```

### Option C: Move Vercel Config to Root

Create a `vercel.json` at the **repository root** (not inside Frontend folder):

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/"
    }
  ]
}
```

And update **Root Directory** in Vercel settings to: `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP FIX (MOST RELIABLE)

### 1. Update Vercel Project Settings

```
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
→ Click your project
→ Settings (top navigation)
→ General (left sidebar)
→ Root Directory section:
   Click "Edit"
   Enter: Frontend/material-kit-react-main
   Save
```

### 2. Verify Build Settings

```
Still in Settings:
→ Build & Development Settings:
   Framework Preset: Next.js ✓
   Build Command: npm run build (or leave default)
   Output Directory: .next (or leave default)
   Install Command: npm install (or leave default)
```

### 3. Redeploy

```
→ Go to Deployments tab
→ Find latest failed deployment
→ Click "..." (three dots)
→ Click "Redeploy"
→ Wait ~2-3 minutes
```

## 🔎 CHECKING DEPLOYMENT LOGS

### How to View Build Errors:

1. **Go to Deployments page** (you're already there)
2. **Click on a failed deployment** (e.g., "5nKGEv8eU")
3. **Check these tabs:**
   - **Building** - Shows build errors
   - **Functions** - Shows function errors (if any)
   - **Runtime Log** - Shows runtime errors

### What to Look For:

```
❌ "No such file or directory"
   → Root directory is wrong

❌ "Cannot find module"
   → Missing dependency in package.json

❌ "Build failed"
   → Check specific error in build log

❌ "ENOENT: no such file"
   → File path issue
```

## 💡 IF STILL FAILING

### Create a New Vercel Project with Correct Settings

1. **Delete current Vercel project** (if needed)
   - Settings → Advanced → Delete Project

2. **Import again with correct configuration:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use Vercel CLI
cd /Users/sakshammishra/OperationFInance/Frontend/material-kit-react-main
vercel

# Answer prompts:
# Set up and deploy? Y
# Which scope? [Your account]
# Link to existing project? N
# Project name? operation-finance
# Directory? ./
```

This ensures Vercel sees your Next.js app directly.

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: Use Monorepo Configuration

If you want to keep your current structure, create a `vercel.json` at **repository root**:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "Frontend/material-kit-react-main/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "Frontend/material-kit-react-main/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then push this change.

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After applying fixes:

- [ ] Root directory set to `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`
- [ ] Framework preset is "Next.js"
- [ ] Redeployed the project
- [ ] Build logs show "Building..." then "Success"
- [ ] Deployment shows green checkmark ✓
- [ ] Can visit the Vercel URL

---

## 🆘 QUICK COMMANDS TO RUN NOW

### 1. Test Build Locally First
```bash
cd /Users/sakshammishra/OperationFInance/Frontend/material-kit-react-main
npm install
npm run build
```

If this succeeds, your code is fine - it's a Vercel configuration issue.

### 2. Update vercel.json at Root
```bash
cd /Users/sakshammishra/OperationFInance
cat > vercel.json << 'EOF'
{
  "buildCommand": "cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "cd Frontend/material-kit-react-main && npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": "Frontend/material-kit-react-main/.next"
}
EOF

git add vercel.json
git commit -m "fix: Configure Vercel for subdirectory deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

## 📞 IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Do this NOW:**

1. **Click on the latest failed deployment** in your screenshot
2. **Look at the error message** in the build log
3. **Take a screenshot** of the error
4. **Apply the Root Directory fix** above

Most likely, you just need to set: **Root Directory = `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`**

---

## 🎉 EXPECTED SUCCESS

After fixing, you should see:
```
✓ Building...
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
✓ Deployment ready
```

And the deployment will show **"Ready"** with a green checkmark instead of red "Error".
