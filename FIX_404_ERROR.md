# 🚨 FIXING: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND ERROR

## Current Error:
```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
This deployment cannot be found.
```

## ❌ What This Means:
Vercel deployed your project, but it's looking in the **wrong directory** for your app. Your Next.js app is in `Frontend/material-kit-react-main/` but Vercel is looking at the repository root.

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX - DO THIS NOW:

### Step 1: Configure Root Directory in Vercel

**This is THE most important step:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click your project** (OperationFInance)
3. **Click "Settings"** (top navigation)
4. **Click "General"** (left sidebar)
5. **Scroll to "Root Directory"** section
6. **Click "Edit"** button
7. **Enter:** `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`
8. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy

1. **Go to "Deployments"** tab
2. **Find the latest deployment**
3. **Click the "..." (three dots) menu**
4. **Select "Redeploy"**
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes**

---

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE FIX: Update vercel.json

The current `vercel.json` at the root might not be working correctly. Let's update it:

### Update Your vercel.json

Replace the content with this simpler version:

```json
{
  "installCommand": "npm install --prefix Frontend/material-kit-react-main",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build --prefix Frontend/material-kit-react-main",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev --prefix Frontend/material-kit-react-main",
  "outputDirectory": "Frontend/material-kit-react-main/.next"
}
```

Or even simpler - delete the root `vercel.json` and **ONLY** set the Root Directory in Vercel dashboard.

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Clean Setup

### Option A: Use Vercel CLI (Easiest & Most Reliable)

This ensures Vercel sees your Next.js app directly:

```bash
# Navigate to your Next.js directory
cd /Users/sakshammishra/OperationFInance/Frontend/material-kit-react-main

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (this will prompt you)
vercel --prod

# Answer prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? [Select your account]
# - Link to existing project? Y (if asked)
# - What's your project name? operation-finance
# - In which directory is your code? ./ (current directory)
```

This method deploys directly from the Next.js folder, avoiding the subdirectory issue entirely.

### Option B: Fix Current Deployment

1. **Set Root Directory** (as shown above)
2. **Verify Build Settings:**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (or leave default)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (or leave default)
   - Install Command: `npm install` (or leave default)

3. **Important:** The paths in Build Settings are **relative to Root Directory**, not repository root!

## 📝 WHY THIS HAPPENED

### The Problem:
Your repository structure:
```
OperationFInance/              ← Vercel sees this as root
├── backend/
├── Frontend/
│   └── material-kit-react-main/  ← Your Next.js app is HERE
│       ├── package.json
│       ├── next.config.mjs
│       └── src/
└── vercel.json
```

When you visit your Vercel URL, it's looking for the app at the **repository root**, but your app is **2 folders deep**.

### The Solution:
Tell Vercel where your app actually is by setting **Root Directory** to `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION STEPS

After applying the fix:

### Check These Settings in Vercel:

1. **Project Settings → General → Root Directory:**
   ```
   ✓ Should say: Frontend/material-kit-react-main
   ```

2. **Project Settings → General → Framework Preset:**
   ```
   ✓ Should say: Next.js
   ```

3. **Build & Development Settings:**
   ```
   Build Command: npm run build (default is fine)
   Output Directory: .next (default is fine)
   Install Command: npm install (default is fine)
   ```

### After Redeploying:

1. **Build logs should show:**
   ```
   ✓ Installing dependencies
   ✓ Building Next.js application
   ✓ Compiled successfully
   ✓ Deployment ready
   ```

2. **Visiting your URL should show:**
   ```
   Your actual website (not 404)
   ```

---

## 💡 QUICK COMPARISON

### ❌ WRONG (What's Happening Now):
```
Vercel looks at: OperationFInance/ (root)
Expects to find: package.json, next.config.mjs
Actually finds: backend/, Frontend/, README.md
Result: 404 NOT_FOUND
```

### ✅ CORRECT (After Fix):
```
Vercel looks at: OperationFInance/Frontend/material-kit-react-main/
Expects to find: package.json, next.config.mjs
Actually finds: ✓ package.json, ✓ next.config.mjs, ✓ src/
Result: Your website loads! 🎉
```

---

## 🚀 DO THIS RIGHT NOW:

### Fastest Fix (2 minutes):

1. **Open:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click:** Your project
3. **Settings** → **General** → **Root Directory** → **Edit**
4. **Type:** `Frontend/material-kit-react-main`
5. **Save**
6. **Deployments** → **Latest** → **"..." menu** → **Redeploy**

That's it! Within 2-3 minutes, your site should work.

## 🆘 IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Try the Vercel CLI Method:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Go to your Next.js directory
cd /Users/sakshammishra/OperationFInance/Frontend/material-kit-react-main

# Remove the link to the current project
rm -rf .vercel

# Deploy fresh
vercel --prod

# This will:
# 1. Detect it's a Next.js app ✓
# 2. Build and deploy correctly ✓
# 3. Give you a working URL ✓
```

---

## 📊 EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Apply fix:** 1 minute
- **Redeploy:** 2-3 minutes
- **Total:** ~5 minutes to working site

---

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it worked when:
- ✓ No more "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error
- ✓ Your actual website loads
- ✓ You see your login/signup page
- ✓ Deployment shows "Ready" with green checkmark

---

**Go set that Root Directory NOW!** This is a 30-second fix that will solve everything! 🚀

After you set it and redeploy, let me know if it works!
