## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Login Still Fails:

   ```

2. **Check Frontend is Running:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3000
   # Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ```

3. **Try Different User:**
   Use `demo_beginner` / `Demo123!` instead

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   Press F12, look for errors in Console tab

5. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
